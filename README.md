## Description
Conduct an analysis of tweets produced by Russian trolls during the 2016 US election, specifically tweets that mention Trump. 

Involves use and manipulation of Pandas dataframes, CSV and TSV in order to produce the required statistic.
## Results
Trump is explicitly mentioned only 2.2% in the dataset.
## Counting problems observed
Some tweets refer to Trump but they do not use his actual name and instead refer to him in different ways such as Mr. President. These tweets are not counted.

We're also counting the retweets as new tweets although the same author retweeted their own tweet, which adds extra counts when there shouldn't technically be.
